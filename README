PW  this is a web-server designed to be "ready to use", rather than a web-framework to build apps like Rails or Sinatra

Request -> files -> RDF model -> RDF or NonRDF Response

if you want a purely-RDF server you can likely get away with the Rack::LinkedData handler from RDF.rb
we support the classic RDF content-negotiation as above and add the following:
 - cached "parsing" of a variety of non-RDF MIMEs to RDF model including email-messages, Atom/RSS feeds, chatlogs, text-files, CSV, Markdown, highlighted-code etc
 - serializing to non-RDF MIMEs including Atom/RSS feeds and retro lynx-compatible HTML
 - a more full-featured HTTP handler doing most things linked-data clients expect (behavior similar to https://github.com/linkeddata/gold/ , https://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play)
 - handle customization of file-search, summarization + HTML view-rendering on a RDF-Typeclass basis
 - supplied customizations for common use-cases like email and full-text search

PREREQUISITES
 install ruby bundler libssl-dev libgit2-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev cmake pkg-config

  ruby - the language this software is written in
  bundler - installs library dependencies for ruby
  libgit - enable fs-state history browsing
  libssl - enables client-certificates for WebID authentication
  lib{xml,xslt} - used by nokogiri to sanitize HTML input
  cmake, pkg-config - toolchain-support for ruby extension-building

INSTALL cd pw/ruby     # enter source-dir
	./install      # symlink source-code to lib-path
        bundle install # install Ruby-dependencies
USE     cd ..          # goto server-root (can be elsewhere, but copy or link {css,js})
        ln conf/server/Procfile . # select daemon
        foreman start  # run HTTP/HTTPS daemons on port 80/443
NOTE
- to listen on 80/443 (optional, another angle is listen >1024 behind apache/nginx/lighttpd)
 $ setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(realpath `which ruby`)

- shell-binding to resource methods. ex: R http://myblog.com feeds
 $ cp ruby/R ~/bin

- wipe RDF cache
 $ rm -rf cache
