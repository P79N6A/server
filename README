pw is a HTTP daemon

designed to be light and lightweight on dependencies - no SQL or SPARQL runtime-engines, just file-backing. it has a few features beyond trivial file-serving considered a bare-minumum to becoming a usable server:

HTTP
 - controller conforms to linked-data workflows (behaves similar to https://github.com/linkeddata/gold/ and https://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play) outlined in http://linkeddata.github.io/SoLiD/
 - authentication of users: WebID claim-verification
 - accept edits and uploads on PUT and POST
 - provide a basic editor for browsers using <form>, bootstrap (third-party) JS+SPARQL editor for modern user-agents
 - paging large-containers: summarization, Link headers, sorted-ranges, offsets/cursors
 - automagic indexing of encountered filesystem-origin data, which combined with the flexible paging gets use out of a (No-)SQL dependency for common use-cases

 MIME
 - parse Non-RDF to RDF: mail-messages, Atom/RSS feeds, chatlogs, text-files, CSV, Markdown, highlighted-code
 - serialize to Non-RDF: Atom/RSS feeds and lynx/links/w3m-compatible HTML[1234]
 - MIME-transcode accessible via HTTP content-negotiation
 - alternative to HTTP-header based content-negotiation using name-extension (suffix) hints 
 - alternative to "slower" MIMEs using pure-Ruby RDF-parsers w/ the native JSON-library and a subset of RDF

 FRAMEWORK
 - customize behaviour by binding lambdas to RDF-typeclasses
 - domain-configurations for email, lifestream/newsfeed/timeline-aggregation, full-text/indexed search and unindexed-search (find + grep)
 - stored URIs are relative and late-bound. mount your data on any hostname, on HTTP or HTTPS and manage it with common filesystem tools (cp, rsync, NFS)

PREREQUISITES
 install ruby bundler libssl-dev libgit2-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev cmake pkg-config

INSTALL cd pw/ruby     # enter source-dir
	./install      # symlink source-code to lib-path
        bundle install # install Ruby-dependencies
USE     cd ..          # goto server-root (can be elsewhere, but copy or link {css,js})
        ln conf/server/Procfile . # select daemon
        foreman start  # run HTTP/HTTPS daemons on port 80/443
NOTE
- open a REPL:
 $ irb -rww
- to listen on 80/443 (optional, already can listen >1024 behind apache/nginx/lighttpd)
 $ setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(realpath `which ruby`)
- shell-binding to resource methods. ex: R http://bl.og feeds
 $ cp ruby/R ~/bin 
- wipe RDF cache
 $ rm -rf cache
