PW is a HTTP-daemon conforming to conventions outlined in http://linkeddata.github.io/SoLiD/ , features include:

 - cached "parsing" of a variety of non-RDF MIMEs to RDF model including email-messages, Atom/RSS feeds, chatlogs, text-files, CSV, Markdown, highlighted-code etc
 - serializing to non-RDF MIMEs including Atom/RSS feeds and retro lynx-compatible HTML
 - transcoding between RDF.rb and our added MIMEs accessible via HTTP content-negotiation
 - an alternative to HTTP-header based content-negotiation via name-extension (suffix) hints
 - an alternative to slower pure-Ruby RDF-parsers via the native JSON-library and a speed-optimized subset of RDF
 - HTTP handler doing many things linked-data clients expect (https://github.com/linkeddata/gold/ , https://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play)
 - pagination of large-containers including summarization, Link headers, sorted-ranges, offsets/cursors
 - authentication of users via WebID claim-verification
 - accepting of edits on PUT or POST and a basic editor for basic-browsers
 - customization of behaviour by binding lambdas to RDF-typeclasses
 - customizations for: email, lifestream/newsfeed/timeline-aggregation, full-text search and basic unindexed-search - find, sort, grep

PREREQUISITES
 install ruby bundler libssl-dev libgit2-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev cmake pkg-config

INSTALL cd pw/ruby     # enter source-dir
	./install      # symlink source-code to lib-path
        bundle install # install Ruby-dependencies
USE     cd ..          # goto server-root (can be elsewhere, but copy or link {css,js})
        ln conf/server/Procfile . # select daemon
        foreman start  # run HTTP/HTTPS daemons on port 80/443
NOTE
- open a REPL:
 $ irb -rww
- to listen on 80/443 (optional, another angle is listen >1024 behind apache/nginx/lighttpd)
 $ setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(realpath `which ruby`)
- shell-binding to resource methods. ex: R http://bl.og feeds
 $ cp ruby/R ~/bin 
- wipe RDF cache
 $ rm -rf cache
