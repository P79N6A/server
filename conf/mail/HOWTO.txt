HOWTO pw as a webmail-system

1. make messages visible to the server
 ~ ln -s /home/hyper/.mail/2016 domain/hostname

2. browse messages. to see all of today's messages:
 $ firefox hostname/today
  domain/localhost/2016/01/16/msg.ABCD on the filesystem is made accessible at
  http://localhost/2016/01/16/msg.ABCD.html

  RDF-links point to archive-location, original messages can be removed

NOTES 
 the provided .procmailrc should ensure message filename
  begin with msg. or end with .eml. otherwise FILE(1) will be invoked to sniff

 all derived-files are contained in address/ for easy removal and one-path route-handling
