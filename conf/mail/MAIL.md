# [webize mail](http://m.whats-your.name)

1. make messages visible to the server

``` sh
ln -s ~/.mail/2016 domain/localhost
```

2. browse messages

``` sh
$ chromium localhost/today
```

## URL structure
* author and message **resources** and indexed message-**containers** under **/address**
* dynamic-handler at **/thread** reconstructs discussions

to wipe data generated by the daemon:

``` sh
rm -rf address cache index
```

alternately  message-files can be removed after being cached by the server

``` sh
rm -rf ~/.mail
```

messages can also be cached client-side by [browsing](https://github.com/linkeddata/tabulator) them with a data-browser
