HOWTO: browse to email files on HTTP

http://localhost/today

two dirs accumulate content, rm -rf at your leisure:
address/  an index relating addresses and messages
msg/      storage of messages at Message-ID-derived location

these dirs and message are not linked to a server by default

cd domain/localhost
ln -s ~/.mail/ .
ln -s ../../address ../../msg .
