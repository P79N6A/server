<h2>timegraph</h2><p>
is a timeline and graph-layout in one
<p>
<b>timegraph</b> is in of a basket of visualizations, collectively dubbed <a href=http://gitorious.org/element/element/trees/master/ruby/W/examine style="font-weight:bold">examine</a> which can be invoked by selecting their view in a query string. 
<p>
a more primitive <b>scale</b> a simple one-dimensional display
<p><a href=http://gitorious.org/element/element/blobs/master/ruby/W/examine/scale.rb>
<img src=scale.png></a><p>
with overlapping values you might want a <b>histogram</b> which instead puts things into bins<p><a href=http://gitorious.org/element/element/blobs/master/ruby/W/examine/hist.rb><img src=hist.png></a><p> 
any value which can be cast to float works with these views, including Time values, which are transparently converted to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>seconds-since-epoch</a><p>

to instantiate a timegraph, add <b>view=tg</b> to query string:<p><img src=tg.png><p>

you may notice there are a lot of lines (arcs) in this. <A href=http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html>indeed - emails</a> often include references to all parent-messages back to thread-origination, but we're mainly interested in the previous message. timegraph accepts an <b>arc</b> attribute to select a property for arc display.<p>

first i'll pull up the last 555 emails in the "top threads" view to find a thread<p><a href=http://gitorious.org/element/element/blobs/master/ruby/W/mail.rb><img src=top.png></a><p>
<p>and look at <A href=http://sioc-project.org/>direct replies </a>
<img src=thread.png><p>
node <b>l</b>abels are another option, a comma-seperate list of RDF predicate-names, common prefixes shrunken is fine <b>sioc:name,dc:date</b> <p><img src=threada.png>
<p><b>g</b>roups are probably self-explanatory, in this next view group-by is a <b>chan</b>nel property of a message, and non-time <b>a</b>xis is set to a <b>lineCount</b> property generated by <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://blog.whats-your.name/post/2011/02/14/sifting-thru-your-IRC-logs-w/-examine">log scanning code</a>
<p><img src=hi.png style="max-width:80em"><p>in some cases, resources contain links to next/previous but not always. a <a href=http://repo.or.cz/w/element.git/blob/HEAD:/ruby/W/examine/time.rb#l5>named-filter</a> was created to decorate the runtime model with these links based on time fields, and the chart begins looking like a more familiar line-graph of time-series data<p>there are a few more features crammed in this view, the time-axis is also overridable to be anything else, in which case you have a graph-layout view with 2-dimensions beyond arcs for resource placement, all configurable from query-string contortions<p>
view was implemented using a standard style which allows a <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-semweb-ui/2011Feb/0001.html>faceted-filterer</a> to turn on or off parts of the graph based on external filter parameters<p>
<a href=tafting.html>tafting visualization</a> is another use case
