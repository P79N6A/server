<h1>element</h1>

<h2>power of limitations</h2>
the 80s are an interesting era for dance music, despite incredibly primitive tools like drum-machines limited to 16th-note positions, and 128K of sample RAM to work with - which was a second or two - numerous classics were produced like <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQYDiu2RpDc&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=AVGxdCwVVULXeSKmpdjgewNJ9YjcKbHruB>altered states</a> and entire catalogue of <a href=http://www.discogs.com/label/Dance+Mania>Dance Mania</a> and <a href=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mr+fingers+amnesia>Mr Fingers</a>
<p>the limitations imposed on element are for few <b>dependencies</b>. if external utilities are used they will be via <b>shell</b> as bindings have historically caused a host of FFI-related leak/crash issues and are not available on non-C rubies like JRuby or Ruboto. this cuts down significantly on exponential/quadratic likely-breakage as depended-upon libs upgrade or version-pinned deps fail to run on a newer Ruby, both of which i experienced quite a bit due to 1.8-1.9 transition and even more basic issues like <a href=http://www.mail-archive.com/mongrel-users@rubyforge.org/msg02669.html>rubygems</a> <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2011Sep/0003.html>breaking</a>. one of my heroes, <a href=http://drobilla.net/software/serd/>drobilla</a> touts his projects as <b>dependency-free</b>. im not quite that extreme and depend on <b>rack</b>.<p>

another prohibition was external <b>database daemons</b>. this was borne out of repeated issues with mysql being upgraded by a package manager, somehow puking on old config files, and needing TLC to restart. and the fact that i dont want to go inserting and spidering the whole disk. a <b>request-time database</b> is populated by translating <b>filesystem</b> data to <b>RDF</b>
<h1>applications</h1>
instead of blindly stabbing-in-dark, i had various applications i wanted to use, such as general-purpose <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2011Mar/0013.html>email/webmail</a>, <a href=http://blog.whats-your.name/post/2011/02/06/AV>media-player</a>, <a href=http://blog.whats-your.name/post/2010/10/25/aint-no-winer>feed reader</a>, and <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-semweb-ui/2011Feb/0001.html>faceted-visualizer</a> and these apps and above limitations drove the creation of a framework that would be adaptable to these needs
<h2>triplestore</h2>
a store for RDF is achieved in various ways. either creating files of RDF or non-RDF format - in which case you define a <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2010Sep/0001.html>triplizer</a> - or direct inserting and indexing on a filesystem-backed store implemented by the <b>trie</b> structure inherent in paths
<h2>webserver</h2>
the interface to the storage and triplizing / rendering layer is of course <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2011Mar/0021.html>HTTP</a>. even when i'm reading mail on my phone, theres a little server running. this frees from having to work with platform-specific GUI APIs
<h2>email</h2>
i'd been using mutt, and tried GMail for a month. some people had new takes on mutt with a greater flexibility on search, namely <a href=http://sup.rubyforge.org/>sup</a> &amp; <a href=http://notmuchmail.org/>notmuch</a>. i wanted to leave terminal-based email and use a browser for inline links &amp; images and usability on non-keyboard devices. existing tools are quite good at writing a message and delivering emails to files on disk, and the gaps are filled with infrastructure described before
<h2>news / lifestreams</h2>
i could cut down on time checking into various tools and apps by integrating everything into a single timeline. it turned out <a href=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203833104577072162782422558.html>some guy</a> wrote his PhD thesis on this in the mid 90s. amusingly i saw an email from my <a href=http://blog.steinberg.org>boss </a> while in SF in one of the screenshots, to inquire about said project.. 
<h2>visualization</h2>
around 2005 a group at MIT called <a href=http://simile.mit.edu/>Simile</a> was coming up with a variety of data-presentation tools with names like <b>Exhibit</b> and <b>Timeline</b>. i'm quite a fan of these but encountered performance issues with my one intended use-case of Exhibit and it seemed like a good challenge to come up with something fast enough. after banging my head on index structures for a bit and considering using a server-component (choice of newly-funded Exhibit3) i realized CSS could be used to filter the result set. thus began <a href=http://blog.whats-your.name/post/2011/02/14/sifting-thru-your-IRC-logs-w/-examine>exa</a><a href=http://blog.whats-your.name/post/2011/02/14/sifting-thru-your-IRC-logs-w/-examine>mine</a> an minimalist realization of the core-functionality of Exhibit and eventually other ideas such as <a href=http://blog.whats-your.name/public/timegraph.html>timegraph</a> and <a href=http://vis.stanford.edu/>protovis/d3 alternatives</a> for basics like <a href=http://i574.photobucket.com/albums/ss187/ix9/hyper/2010-06-29-090524_1368x768_scrot.png>histograms</a> and finally output modes to serve as input to Protovis and the aforementioned Simile tools in the first place
